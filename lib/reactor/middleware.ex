defmodule Reactor.Middleware do
  @moduledoc """
  The Middleware behaviour.

  By implementing this behaviour you can modify the internal state of the
  Reactor during startup, execution and shutdown.

  Middlewares can be added to the reactor either with the `middlewares` DSL
  section or by the `add_middleware/2`, etc, functions in `Reactor.Builder`.

  All callbacks in this behaviour are optional so you can define only the parts
  you need for your feature.
