Reactor is a dynamic, concurrent, dependency resolving saga orchestrator.

Woah. That's a lot. Let's break it down:

- **Saga orchestrator** A [saga][saga pattern] is a way of providing
  transaction-like semantics across multiple distinct resources.
- **Dependency resolving** reactor allows you to describe the dependencies
  between your saga steps using _arguments_ which are converted into a
  [DAG][dag] and used to compute execution order.
- **Concurrent** unless otherwise specified reactor will run as many steps as
  possible concurrently whilst taking into account the results of the dependency
  resolution.
- **Dynamic** whilst you can define a reactor statically using our awesome DSL,
  you can also build workflows dynamically - and even add steps while the
  reactor is running.
