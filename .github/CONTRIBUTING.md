# Contributing to Spark

* We have a zero tolerance policy for failure to abide by our code of conduct. It is very standard, but please make sure
  you have read it.
* Issues may be opened to propose new ideas, to ask questions, or to file bugs.
* Before working on a feature, please talk to the core team/the rest of the community via a proposal. We are 
  building something that needs to be cohesive and well thought out across all use cases. Our top priority is 
  supporting real life use cases like yours, but we have to make sure that we do that in a sustainable way. The 
  best compromise there is to make sure that discussions are centered around the *use case* for a feature, rather
  than the proposed feature itself.
